Write a javascript function named “find_consecutive_runs” that accepts as an argument a list of integers. 

- It must find in that list all runs of 3 consecutive numbers that increase or decrease by 1 
  - `[ x, x+1, x+2 ]` or `[ x, x-2, x-3 ]`
- It should return the list indices of the first element of each run 
- If there are no consecutive runs it should output `No Runs Found`

Example Input: [1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 7, 8, 7]
